# Test Plan 

The test table template generated by HDLGen-ChatGPT can be copied and pasted into Excel.
When copied into Excel you may have to set the cells to "Text" to prevent leading zeros from being truncated by Excel.
Once you have filled out the test table template, you can copy it from Excel and paste it back into the textbox which appears when "Edit Testplan" is pressed.


The template is generated by HDLGen-ChatGPT when the project is created. To prevent overwriting any completed test plan work, you must manually reset the test plan template any time you add or remove a signal (or optionally add/remove the signal from the test plan yourself)


The test table is a tab-separated table with each table row terminated by a newline character.
