vhdlchatgptheader = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for formatting VHDL header sections in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Generate VHDL code for the logic described in each line containing prefix '---'
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '---'
	Ensure that assignment bit widths are compatible
	Do not replace any of the existing lines which include '-- Default assignment'
	Use signal type conversion and resize signals for the addout arithmetic assignment, assuming numeric_std VHDL library
	Use signal type conversion for the NSMultIndex arithmetic assignments
vhdlchatgptmodel = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for generating VHDL models in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	=== Optional ChatCPT messages for VHDL model development, which can be submitted sequentially after the ChatGPT run ===
	Keep the '-- Default assignment' text on the same line as the original assignment, unchanged, and immediately before the VHDL logic generated for lines containing prefix '---'
	Place the VHDL process line containing '-- Default assignment', unchanged, and immediately before the VHDL logic generated for lines containing prefix '---'
	For all assignments which include arithmetic operators '+', '-', '*', '/', in processes or concurrent statements, use 'ieee.numeric_std' package signal type conversion functions
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '---'
	
	=== Default ChatGPT message header set for VHDL model development === Excluding this line
	Complete the following VHDL model, and output in a code box
	Do not include any assignment when-else VHDL constructs (conditional VHDL) inside process VHDL code (only supported in ieee 1076-2008)
	Do not add any new library 'use' statements, to avoid conflicts with the ieee.numeric_std package functions
	For each line containing the prefix '---', replace with generated VHDL code for the logic described, and remove the '---'
	For all assignments which include arithmetic operators '+' or '-', in processes or concurrent statements, use 'ieee.numeric_std' package signal type conversion functions
	For all assignments which include a shift operation, only use ieee.numeric_std package shift_left or shift_right functions, and do not use sra, srl, sll functions.
	In VHDL processes, place the modified line containing suffix '-- Default assignment' immediately before the VHDL statements generated for lines containing prefix '---'
	Do not include any assignments which duplicate the signal assignment values, for assignments labelled '-- Default assignment'
	Leave all labels unchanged
vhdlchatgpttestbench = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful
	Generate VHDL stimulus for the signal assignment sequence defined in the table, where the signal value in the table does not contain a '-'
	Use the input signal radix format specified in table row 3
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '---'
	Each subsequent row represents a change in signal values at a particular time, indicated by the "delay" column
	Include a delay by the amount (in units of signal period) in the delay column  after all of the signal assignments for each test have been applied
	Do not add any delay statements that are not included in the table
	Include comment, with the Note field at the start of each test
	Do not include a note describing the signal input values
	Test the output signal values in the column, and output a message if the test fails
	Output stim_p process code, in a formatted code box  including testNo
verilogchatgptheader = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for formatting VERILOG header sections in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Complete the following Verilog model, and output in a code box
	For each line containing the prefix '///', replace with generated Verilog code for the logic described, and remove the '///'
	Place the modified line containing suffix '// Default assignment' 
	immediately before the VHDL statements generated for lines containing prefix '///'
	Do not include any assignments which duplicate the signal assignment values, for 
	assignments labelled '// Default assignment'
	Leave all labels unchanged

	Do not output the lines containing prefix '///'
	Output only the code for process muxOut_p, in a formatted code box
	Make assignment bit widths compatible

verilogchatgpttestbench = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for generating VERILOG testbenches in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Generate VERILOG stimulus for the signal assignment sequence defined in the table, where the signal value in the table does not contain a '-'
	Each subsequent row represents a change in signal values at a particular time  indicated by the "delay" column.
	Use the input signal radix format specified in table row 3
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '///'
	Include a "# (delay value)", after the signal assignments for the row have been applied, with delay value = the value in the row delay column. Include the delay value in brackets.
	Include a comment with the 'Note' field, at the start of each test
	Test the output signal values with the values in the 'Output signals' column, and output a message if the test fails
	Output the stim_p process code, in a formatted code box, including testNo
