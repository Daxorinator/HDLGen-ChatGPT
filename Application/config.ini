VHDLchatgptheader = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for formatting VHDL header sections in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	This is a VHDL model header section
	Improve formatting of the signal dictionary descriptions
	Output all text in a formatted code box
VHDLchatgptmodel = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for generating VHDL models in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Generate VHDL code in a formatted code box, for the logic described in each line containing prefix '---'
	Ensure that assignment bit widths are compatible
	Cast signals to ensure that the types of the operands are compatible in assignments
	Place the line including 'Default assignment' before the logic described in lines ocntaining prefix ///
	Do not replace any of the existing lines which include 'Default assignment'
	Do not generate duplicate code for any of the existing lines which include 'Default assignment'
	Output only process and concurrent statement code in a formatted code box
	Output only process NSDecode_p code in a formatted code box	
VHDLchatgpttestbench = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for generating VHDL testbenches in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Generate VHDL stimulus for the signal assignment sequence defined in the table
	Include VHDL signal assignments using each signal radix format, specified in table row 2
	Each subsequent row represents a change in signal values at a particular time, indicated by the "delay" column.
	A '-' in an input signal row entry indicates that the signal value does not change from its value in the previous row, and that an assignment to the signal at this point is not required
	Include a delay by the amount (in units of signal period) in the delay column, after all of the signal assignments for each test have been applied
	Do not add any delay statements that are not included in the table
	Include comment, with the Note field at the start of each test
	Do not include a note describing the signal input values
	Test the output signal values in the column, and output a message if the test fails
	Output stim_p process code, in a formatted code box, including testNo
    Output stim_p process code, starting from table rows testNo = 11, and ending at testNo = 17, in a formatted code box

Verilogchatgptmodel = This text includes ChatGPT commands which have been found useful for generating VERILOG models in a series of projects. Copy, paste, edit in the top text box as required.
	Generate Verilog code in a formatted code box, for the logic described in each line containing prefix '//
	Ensure that assignment bit widths are compatible
	In Verilog models, cast signals to ensure that the types of the operands are compatible in assignments
	Place the line including 'Default assignment' before the logic described in lines ocntaining prefix ///
	Do not replace any of the existing lines which include 'Default assignment'
	Do not generate duplicate code for any of the existing lines which include 'Default assignment'
	Output only the code for process muxOut_p, in a formatted code box
