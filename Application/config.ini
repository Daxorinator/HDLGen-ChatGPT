vhdlchatgptheader = This is a VHDL model header section.
	Improve formatting of the signal dictionary descriptions.
	Output in a formatted code box.
vhdlchatgptmodel = # This ChatGPT message header is used with the HDLGen-generated HDL model template (which can include pseudo code logic descriptions) to generate the complete HDL model.
	Complete the following VHDL model, and output in a single formatted code box.
	Output "Created by HDLGen https://github.com/fearghal1/HDLGen", date, time
	For each line between -- Title section start and -- Title section end, improve formatting of the text.
	For each line containing the prefix '---', replace with generated VHDL code for the logic described, and remove the '---'.
	For each line containing '_c:' in the label, do not generate a sequential statement, do not remove the label containing '_c:', remove the '---', and remove '-- Default assignment'
	Remove all assignments in if or case statements which duplicate the default assignment.
	In VHDL processes, place the modified line containing suffix '-- Default assignment' immediately before the VHDL statements generated for lines containing prefix '---'.
	Leave all labels unchanged.
	For every assignment that includes an add (+) or subtract (-) operation, use 'ieee.numeric_std' package signal type conversion functions to ensure correct VHDL syntax.
	In assignments which include sign extending by one bit, use single quotes to define the single bit.
	If using std_logic_vector signal as array index, use numeric_std to_integer function on unsigned signal
	For every assignment which includes a shift operation, only use ieee.numeric_std package shift_left or shift_right functions, and do not use sra, srl, sll, shift_right_arithmetic functions.
	Use if statements rather than conditional statements inside VHDL case or if statements
	Do not add any new library 'use' statements, to avoid conflicts with the ieee.numeric_std package functions.
	=== For reference. Delete the following lines.
	=== List of Optional ChatGPT messages, which can be submitted individually after the above ChatGPT message, if the Chat GPT output is not fully correct.
	Repeat, without outputting all lines between, and including '-- Title section start' and '-- Title section end'
	Output <process NSAndOPDecode_p>, ensuring that arithmetic operations use 'ieee.numeric_std' package signal type conversion functions to ensure correct VHDL syntax.
	Output <signalName> assignment, ensuring that arithmetic operations use 'ieee.numeric_std' package signal type conversion functions to ensure correct VHDL syntax.
	Check the <signalName> assignment arithmetic assignment syntax.
	Keep the '-- Default assignment' text on the same line as the original assignment, unchanged, and immediately before the VHDL logic generated for lines containing prefix '---'.
	Place the VHDL process line containing '-- Default assignment', unchanged, and immediately before the VHDL logic generated for lines containing prefix '---'.
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '---'.
vhdlchatgpttestbench = # This ChatGPT message header is used with the testbench signal declarations and test plan to generate the complete HDL testbench.

	Input signal names are included in row 1, output signal names are included in row 2, signal radix is included in row 3.
	TestNo is included in column 1, delay is included in column 3
	
	Create a single VHDL process stim_p, in a formatted code box, starting at row 4, and including the following
	TestNo.
	Comment in the Note column.
	Assignment of every input signal, irrespective of its value. Do not assign any output signals. Use hexadecimal if signal format is greater or equal to 32 bits.
	wait for (delay  * period); statement, where delay can be integer or real, after all signal stimulus for the row have been assigned, using delay value in the delay column, with brackets () around (delay * period).
	Test if each output signal value (though not input signal values) matches the value included in its corresponding row, outputting a fail message if it does not match.

	Improve formatting of the signal dictionary descriptions.
	Output in a formatted code box.
verilogchatgptmodel = # This ChatGPT message header is used with the HDLGen-generated HDL model template (which can include pseudo code logic descriptions) to generate the complete HDL model.
	Complete the following Verilog model, and output in a single formatted code box.
	
	For each line between // Title section start and // Title section end, improve formatting of the text.
	
	For each line containing the prefix '///', replace with generated Verilog code for the logic described, and remove the '///'.
	For each line containing '_c:' in the label, do not generate a sequential statement, do not remove the label containing '_c:', remove the '///', and remove '// Default assignment'
	
	Remove all assignments in if or case statements which duplicate the default assignment.
	Use for loop (format for (i=0; i<32; i=i+1) around complete array signal assignments.
	
	Leave all labels unchanged.
	Place the Verilog process line containing '// Default assignment', unchanged, and immediately before the VHDL logic generated for lines containing prefix '///'.
	Do not output the lines containing prefix '///'.
	Include <= operator in assignments.
	Make assignment bit widths compatible.
