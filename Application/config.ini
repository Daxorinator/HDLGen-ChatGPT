chatgptheader = This is a VHDL model header section
	CG1 Improve formatting of the signal dictionary descriptions
chatgptmodel = This is a VHDL model
	All ChatGPT instructions begin with a CG1 prefix
	CG1 Replace the VHDL model sections between lines "-- User to complete: START" and "-- User top complete: END", to capture the function descriptions.
	CG1 Output all text in a formatted code box
chatgpttestbench = Generate a VHDL testbench stimulus process for the VHDL model below
	Signal load has priority over signal ce
	Do not assert signal rst in any new tests
	Include test fail checking and messages
	use integer number of wait for periods
	Deassert all asserted signals at the end of each test
	Do not include signal stimulus assignments if the signal state has not changed
	Output the VHDL testbench stimulus process stim_p in a formatted code box
