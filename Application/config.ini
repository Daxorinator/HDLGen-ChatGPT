VHDLchatgptheader = This is a VHDL model header section
	Improve formatting of the signal dictionary descriptions
VHDLchatgptmodel = Generate code between the "-- Start of selected portion" and "-- End of selected portion"
	Do not duplicate any of the existing lines which include '-- Default assignment'
	Output all text in a formatted code box
	Generate VHDL code for the logic described in each of the logic tables, and include this code in the VHDL model
	Do not delete any of the lines provided in the source vhdl model
VHDLchatgpttestbench = Generate VHDL stimulus for the signal sequence defined in the table
	Each row represents a change in signal values at a particular time, indicated by the "Wait for" column. 
	The "-" symbol is used to indicate that a signal's value does not change in that particular row.
	Output formatted code
